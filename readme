# 🖼️ Image to ASCII Art (Python)

This script turns any image into ASCII art using Python and Pillow.

---

## 📌 How to Use

1. Install Pillow if you don’t have it:
   ```bash
   pip install pillow
   ```

2. Put your image (e.g., `flagMorrocco.png`) in the same folder.

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python ascii_art.py
   ```

---

## ⚙️ What It Does

* Converts the image to grayscale (black & white).
* Resizes it to fit the terminal.
* Replaces pixels with characters based on brightness.
